# DashMint Lab — NFT marketplace

DashMint Lab is a React + TypeScript + Vite single-page app that exercises every Dash Platform NFT operation: mint, transfer, price, purchase, burn, and query. This walkthrough shows how those SDK calls are organized inside a real UI.

## What this app does

The app lets users log in with a BIP-39 mnemonic, mint "card" NFTs with random attack/defense stats, browse cards across the network, set sale prices, purchase cards from other identities, transfer cards as gifts, and burn cards they no longer want. Read-only browsing works without any credentials.

For background on Dash Platform NFT features such as transfer, trade, delete, and creation restrictions, see the [NFT explanation](../../explanations/nft.md).

## How the code is structured

Every Platform SDK call lives in its own file under `src/dash/`. The React UI is a thin layer on top that wires those functions to forms and buttons. Because the app is browser-based, it imports the same `setupDashClient-core.mjs` module already covered in [Setup SDK Client](../setup-sdk-client.md), so the Node tutorials and this app share one source of truth for client creation and key derivation.

## TL;DR

- Each NFT operation lives in its own `src/dash/*.ts` file.
- The easiest entry points are `src/dash/queries.ts`, `src/dash/mintCard.ts`, and `src/dash/transferCard.ts`.
- Most mutations share one helper: `src/dash/withAuthedCard.ts`.
- The UI mostly passes form input into those functions and renders the results.
- `client.ts` and `keyManager.ts` are thin re-exports of `setupDashClient-core.mjs`.

If you just want the mental model: read the architecture table, then `withAuthedCard.ts`, then whichever operation you care about.

## Prerequisites

- [General prerequisites](../introduction.md#prerequisites) (Node.js / Dash SDK installed)
- A configured client: [Setup SDK Client](../setup-sdk-client.md) — DashMint re-uses `setupDashClient-core.mjs`
- A registered identity: [Register an Identity](../identities-and-names/register-an-identity.md)
- Familiarity with data contracts: [Register a Data Contract](../contracts-and-documents/register-a-data-contract.md) — particularly the NFT tab
- Node >= 20 and a funded testnet identity (BIP-39 mnemonic + identity index)
- (Optional) A second funded identity to test cross-profile transfer and purchase

## Clone and run

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dashpay/platform-tutorials.git
cd platform-tutorials/example-apps/dashmint-lab
npm install
npm run dev
```

The dev server runs on `http://localhost:5173`. Open it in a browser, click **Login**, paste your testnet mnemonic, and start minting. The app ships with a default contract ID so browse-only mode works on a fresh install.

Production build: `npm run build && npm run preview`.

## Architecture tour

Every Platform SDK call lives in its own file under `src/dash/`:

| Operation | File | SDK method |
| --------- | ---- | ---------- |
| Connect to testnet | `src/dash/client.ts` | `EvoSDK.testnetTrusted()` + `sdk.connect()` |
| Derive identity keys | `src/dash/keyManager.ts` | `wallet.deriveKeyFromSeedWithPath` |
| Deploy card contract | `src/dash/contract.ts` | `sdk.contracts.publish` |
| Query cards | `src/dash/queries.ts` | `sdk.documents.query` |
| Mint a card | `src/dash/mintCard.ts` | `sdk.documents.create` |
| Transfer a card | `src/dash/transferCard.ts` | `sdk.documents.transfer` |
| Set / remove price | `src/dash/setPrice.ts` | `sdk.documents.setPrice` |
| Purchase a card | `src/dash/purchaseCard.ts` | `sdk.documents.purchase` |
| Burn (delete) a card | `src/dash/burnCard.ts` | `sdk.documents.delete` |

Two supporting files glue the operations together:

- `src/dash/withAuthedCard.ts` — shared mutation prelude used by transfer, setPrice, purchase, and burn. Fetches the document, bumps its revision, and resolves the auth signer.
- `src/dash/logger.ts` — shared `Logger` type so every operation can stream progress to the UI activity log.

`client.ts` and `keyManager.ts` are just re-exports:

```typescript
export { createClient } from '../../../../setupDashClient-core.mjs';
export { IdentityKeyManager } from '../../../../setupDashClient-core.mjs';
```

That means the connection and key-derivation behavior are the same as in the Node tutorials. Read [Setup SDK Client](../setup-sdk-client.md) for the full client setup details.

## Shared mutation pattern

Every mutation on an existing card — transfer, set price, purchase, burn — runs the same four steps:

1. Get an auth signer for the current identity.
2. Fetch the current on-chain `Document` (needed to know its revision).
3. Bump `document.revision` by 1. Platform rejects state transitions that don't strictly increase the revision.
4. Call the specific SDK method.

`withAuthedCard()` wraps steps 1–3 so each operation file stays focused on its single SDK call. Burn passes `preFetch: false` because `sdk.documents.delete` only needs enough identifying fields, not a full fetched document.

:::{note}
Card mutations sign with the **CRITICAL authentication key** (key 2), which `keyManager.getAuth()` returns. Despite the name, the `TRANSFER` purpose key does **not** authorize document transfers — Platform reserves that key for credit transfers and withdrawals.

## Read path: queries first

If you want to understand how data shows up in the UI, start with `src/dash/queries.ts`. The Collection tab has three sub-views, each backed by a different query: your own cards, every card on the contract, and only the cards that are currently for sale. `normalizeCards()` flattens the three possible shapes the SDK can return (array, `Map`, or plain object) into a single flat list the UI can render.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: queries.ts
:name: dashmint-queries.ts
:emphasize-lines: 48-54,73-78,91-95,108-113

/**
 * Read queries over the card data contract.
 *
 * Three variants backing the Collection tab's sub-tabs:
 *   listMyCards — cards owned by the signed-in identity (uses where $ownerId)
 *   listAllCards — every card across the network (capped limit)
 *   listMarketplaceCards — every card that has a non-null $price
 *
 * normalizeCards() hides the three possible shapes the SDK may return
 * (Array, Map, or plain object) so UI code always sees a plain array of
 * { id, ownerId, data, $price }.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.query({ dataContractId, documentTypeName, where?, limit })

// Platform caps document queries at 100 results per request.
const MAX_QUERY_LIMIT = 100;

export interface Card {

## Operation walkthrough

Each operation file is intentionally small. The app-level pattern is: validate input, prepare a `Document` or reuse `withAuthedCard()`, call one SDK method, then log the result.

### Mint a card

Minting is the simplest write operation: build a `Document` with the card properties and owner, then call `sdk.documents.create`. No existing document to fetch, no revision to bump.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: mintCard.ts
:name: dashmint-mintCard.ts
:emphasize-lines: 52,57-64

/**
 * Mint a new card (create a document against the card data contract).
 *
 * Attack and defense are rolled client-side (1-10 each). Name is required,
 * description is optional.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.create({ document, identityKey, signer })
 */
import { Document } from "@dashevo/evo-sdk";

import type { Logger } from "./logger";
import type { DashKeyManager, DashSdk } from "./types";

export interface MintCardInput {
  name: string;
  description?: string;
  /** Override for deterministic tests. Default: random 1-10. */
  attack?: number;
  /** Override for deterministic tests. Default: random 1-10. */
  defense?: number;
}

export interface MintCardParams {
  sdk: DashSdk;
  keyManager: DashKeyManager;
  contractId: string;
  card: MintCardInput;
  log?: Logger;
}

function rollStat(): number {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 10) + 1;
}

export async function mintCard({
  sdk,
  keyManager,
  contractId,
  card,
  log,
}: MintCardParams): Promise<void> {
  const name = card.name.trim();
  if (!name) throw new Error("Card name is required.");

  const attack = card.attack ?? rollStat();
  const defense = card.defense ?? rollStat();
  const description = card.description?.trim();

  log?.(`Minting "${name}" (ATK ${attack} / DEF ${defense})…`);

  const { identity, identityKey, signer } = await keyManager.getAuth();

  const properties: Record<string, unknown> = { name, attack, defense };
  if (description) properties.description = description;

  const doc = new Document({
    properties,
    documentTypeName: "card",
    dataContractId: contractId,
    ownerId: identity.id,
  });

  await sdk.documents.create({ document: doc, identityKey, signer });
  log?.(`Card "${name}" minted!`, "success");
}
```

### Transfer a card

Transfer hands ownership of an existing card to another identity without a price. The interesting work happens inside `withAuthedCard()`; this file just calls `sdk.documents.transfer` on the prepared document.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: transferCard.ts
:name: dashmint-transferCard.ts
:emphasize-lines: 35,37-43

/**
 * Transfer a card (NFT document) to another identity.
 *
 * Gotcha (see tutorial/nft/CLAUDE.md): transfer uses the AUTHENTICATION
 * key, not the TRANSFER purpose key. The Platform rejects TRANSFER-purpose
 * keys for document state transitions.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.transfer({ document, recipientId, identityKey, signer })
 */
import type { Logger } from "./logger";
import type { DashKeyManager, DashSdk } from "./types";
import { withAuthedCard } from "./withAuthedCard";

export interface TransferCardParams {
  sdk: DashSdk;
  keyManager: DashKeyManager;
  contractId: string;
  cardId: string;
  recipientId: string;
  log?: Logger;
}

export async function transferCard({
  sdk,
  keyManager,
  contractId,
  cardId,
  recipientId,
  log,
}: TransferCardParams): Promise<void> {
  if (!recipientId) throw new Error("Recipient identity ID is required.");
  log?.(`Transferring card ${cardId} to ${recipientId}…`);

  await withAuthedCard(
    { sdk, keyManager, contractId, cardId, errorLabel: "Transfer error", log },
    async ({ doc, identityKey, signer }) => {
      await sdk.documents.transfer({
        document: doc,
        recipientId,
        identityKey,
        signer,
      });
      log?.("Card transferred!", "success");
    },
  );
}
```

### Set or remove a sale price

Pricing a card adds a `$price` field to its document on-chain. That's what the Marketplace tab filters by. Passing `price = 0n` removes the card from sale.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: setPrice.ts
:name: dashmint-setPrice.ts
:emphasize-lines: 33-34,42-48,51-57

/**
 * Set (or remove) the sale price on a card.
 *
 * Pricing a card adds a `$price` field to the document on-chain, which is
 * what the Marketplace tab filters by. Passing price = 0n removes the
 * card from sale.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.setPrice({ document, price, identityKey, signer })
 */
import type { Logger } from "./logger";
import type { DashKeyManager, DashSdk } from "./types";
import { withAuthedCard } from "./withAuthedCard";

export interface SetPriceParams {
  sdk: DashSdk;
  keyManager: DashKeyManager;
  contractId: string;
  cardId: string;
  /** Price in credits. Pass 0 to remove the card from sale. */
  price: number | bigint;
  log?: Logger;
}

export async function setPrice({
  sdk,
  keyManager,
  contractId,
  cardId,
  price,
  log,
}: SetPriceParams): Promise<void> {
  const priceBig = typeof price === "bigint" ? price : BigInt(price);
  const removing = priceBig === 0n;

  log?.(
    removing
      ? `Removing price from card ${cardId}…`
      : `Setting price ${priceBig} credits on card ${cardId}…`,
  );

  await withAuthedCard(
    {
      sdk,
      keyManager,
      contractId,
      cardId,
      errorLabel: removing ? "Remove price error" : "Set price error",
      log,
    },
    async ({ doc, identityKey, signer }) => {
      await sdk.documents.setPrice({
        document: doc,
        price: priceBig,
        identityKey,
        signer,
      });
      log?.(removing ? "Card removed from sale." : "Price set!", "success");
    },
  );
}
```

### Purchase a card

The buying identity pays `price` credits and becomes the new owner in a single state transition. Platform enforces the price server-side — passing a stale price fails the transition.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: purchaseCard.ts
:name: dashmint-purchaseCard.ts
:emphasize-lines: 32,35-41,44-51

/**
 * Purchase a priced card from another identity.
 *
 * The signed-in identity pays `price` credits and becomes the new owner.
 * Platform enforces the price server-side — passing a stale price fails.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.purchase({ document, buyerId, price, identityKey, signer })
 */
import type { Logger } from "./logger";
import type { DashKeyManager, DashSdk } from "./types";
import { withAuthedCard } from "./withAuthedCard";

export interface PurchaseCardParams {
  sdk: DashSdk;
  keyManager: DashKeyManager;
  contractId: string;
  cardId: string;
  /** Price in credits — must match the on-chain $price. */
  price: number | bigint;
  log?: Logger;
}

export async function purchaseCard({
  sdk,
  keyManager,
  contractId,
  cardId,
  price,
  log,
}: PurchaseCardParams): Promise<void> {
  const priceBig = typeof price === "bigint" ? price : BigInt(price);
  log?.(`Purchasing card ${cardId} for ${priceBig} credits…`);

  await withAuthedCard(
    {
      sdk,
      keyManager,
      contractId,
      cardId,
      errorLabel: "Purchase error",
      log,
    },
    async ({ doc, identity, identityKey, signer }) => {
      await sdk.documents.purchase({
        document: doc,
        buyerId: identity.id,
        price: priceBig,
        identityKey,
        signer,
      });
      log?.("Card purchased!", "success");
    },
  );
}
```

### Burn a card

Burn permanently deletes the document from Platform. Unlike the other mutations, delete only needs identifying fields — no full fetched document, no revision bump. That's why `withAuthedCard` is called with `preFetch: false`.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: burnCard.ts
:name: dashmint-burnCard.ts
:emphasize-lines: 32-39,42-52

/**
 * Burn a card — permanently delete the document from the Platform.
 *
 * Unlike the other mutations, burn does NOT need the full fetched Document:
 * the delete API only needs enough identifying fields to locate the target.
 * That's why withAuthedCard() is called with preFetch: false.
 *
 * SDK method: sdk.documents.delete({ document, identityKey, signer })
 */
import type { Logger } from "./logger";
import type { DashKeyManager, DashSdk } from "./types";
import { withAuthedCard } from "./withAuthedCard";

export interface BurnCardParams {
  sdk: DashSdk;
  keyManager: DashKeyManager;
  contractId: string;
  cardId: string;
  log?: Logger;
}

export async function burnCard({
  sdk,
  keyManager,
  contractId,
  cardId,
  log,
}: BurnCardParams): Promise<void> {
  log?.(`Burning card ${cardId}…`);

  await withAuthedCard(
    {
      sdk,
      keyManager,
      contractId,
      cardId,
      preFetch: false,
      errorLabel: "Burn error",
      log,
    },
    async ({ identity, identityKey, signer }) => {
      await sdk.documents.delete({
        document: {
          id: cardId,
          ownerId: identity.id,
          dataContractId: contractId,
          documentTypeName: "card",
        },
        identityKey,
        signer,
      });
      log?.("Card burned.", "success");
    },
  );
}
```

## Contract schema

### What makes this an NFT contract

The card data contract defines one document type (`card`) with four fields and three indices. Three top-level flags turn it into an NFT contract: `transferable: 1` lets owners send cards to other identities, `tradeMode: 1` enables the built-in price/purchase flow, and `creationRestrictionMode: 1` controls who can mint. See the [NFT explanation](../../explanations/nft.md#explanations-dash-nfts) for what each flag does, and the [NFT tab in Register a Data Contract](../contracts-and-documents/register-a-data-contract.md) for the schema in JSON form.

### How the app registers or reuses the contract

`ensureContract()` reuses a previously published contract ID from `localStorage` when one is present, and only calls `sdk.contracts.publish` on first run. That keeps the app usable without forcing every visitor to publish their own contract.

```{code-block} typescript
:caption: contract.ts
:name: dashmint-contract.ts
:emphasize-lines: 21-28,55-58,125-141,167-172

/**
 * NFT card data contract schema + ensureContract().
 *
 * WHAT: A Dash Platform "data contract" defines the schema for documents.
 * This one describes a single document type (`card`) with four fields
 * (name, description, attack, defense) plus three indices so the app can
 * query by owner, attack, or defense.
 *
 * The three flags at the top of the schema are what make this an NFT:
 *   transferable: 1         — documents can be sent to another identity (0 to disable)
 *   tradeMode: 1            — documents can be priced and purchased (0 to disable)
 *   creationRestrictionMode: 1 — (1 - only the contract owner can mint; 0 - anyone can mint)

## Next steps

- Read more about NFT features in the [NFT explanation](../../explanations/nft.md).
- Try the same operations headlessly from Node using the tutorials in [Contracts and documents](../contracts-and-documents.md).
- Fork the app and adapt the contract schema to your own NFT use case. The one-file-per-operation layout under `src/dash/` makes it easy to swap a single operation without touching the rest.

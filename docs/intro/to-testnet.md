# Intro to Testnet

Testnet is the Dash testing network used for experimentation and evaluation of Dash Core and Dash Platform features. As a testing network, Testnet may be subject to occasional updates and changes that break backwards compatibility.

## Network Details

### Infrastructure

Dash Core Group provides the core Testnet infrastructure consisting of 150 masternodes running Dash Core along with the platform services that provide the [decentralized API (DAPI)](explanation-dapi) and [storage (Drive)](explanation-drive) functionality.

Testnet also includes a [block explorer](https://testnet-insight.dashevo.org/insight/) for the core blockchain and a [test Dash faucet](https://testnet-faucet.dash.org/) that dispenses funds to users/developers experimenting on the network.

### Features

The Dash Platform features available on testnet include:

- [Dash Platform Name Service](explanation-dpns) (DPNS): a data contract and supporting logic for name registration
- [Identities](explanation-identity): creation of identities
- [Names](explanation-dpns): creation of DPNS names that link to an identity
- [Data Contracts](doc:explanation-platform-protocol-data-contract): creation of data contracts
- [Documents](doc:explanation-platform-protocol-document): used to store/update/delete data associated with data contracts
- [DashPay](explanation-dashpay): a data contract enableing a decentralized application that creates bidirectional direct settlement payment channels between identities and supports contact (name) based payments

## Getting involved

This network is open for all who are interested in testing and interacting with Dash Platform. To learn how to connect, please jump to the [Connecting to a Network tutorial](tutorial-connecting-to-testnet).

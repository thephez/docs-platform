# Platform Proofs

Platform proofs are an important part of Dash Platform's trust model. A proof is a self-contained
cryptographic object that lets anyone verify a piece of platform state is authentic and was
agreed upon by the validator network -- without trusting whoever supplied the data.

The most common way to obtain a proof is to request one over [DAPI](../explanations/dapi.md): set
the optional `"prove": true` parameter on a [Platform gRPC
endpoint](../reference/dapi-endpoints-platform-endpoints.md) and the response carries a `Proof`
message instead of the plain result. A proof does not depend on how it was retrieved. It
can be verified independently by any party that holds it.

For the concepts behind proofs -- the two-layer GroveDB + consensus trust model, the verification
flow, what can be proven, and asset lock proofs -- see [Proofs](../explanations/proofs.md).

## Proof structure

A `Proof` is a unified [GroveDB](https://github.com/dashpay/grovedb) proof plus the consensus
signature that authenticates it. It has six fields:

| Field | Type | Description |
| - | - | - |
| `grovedbProof` | Bytes (base64) | The GroveDB proof for the requested data. An opaque blob that a verifier decodes to recover the data and the state root hash. |
| `quorumHash` | Bytes (base64) | Hash of the validator quorum that signed the state. |
| `signature` | Bytes (base64) | BLS threshold signature over the signed block, proving the quorum agreed on this state. |
| `round` | Integer | Consensus round the block was finalized in. |
| `blockIdHash` | Bytes (base64) | Hash of the block ID the proof is anchored to. |
| `quorumType` | Integer | Type of the quorum that produced the signature. |

  "proof": {
    "grovedbProof": "APsA/wGQtKE8gXoPHBaBJWO/39M63DsnEkx4Lah9...",
    "quorumHash": "AAAAN0ggLzkGuHl7bJM48baKuEs/b3rhSMSF5kIw14g=",
    "signature": "oc8EMH7WkoZhv06iPvP4HjTlleaRLOfDRvWg30hjXL3z83DpNigk1/8mZwC1jrEDFymkkftcoE+DcPhZu/R8wlP2yxWcWo+605lLqU/FIb29nOt0q6hUbuX+eZL39mdb",
    "round": 0,
    "blockIdHash": "Eq24v2aaWwDXN41oCmduKOYnDRsvoAJwDk8BEHZRDaU=",
    "quorumType": 6
  }
}
```

Two endpoint families depart from this standard structure: compacted address balance proofs use a
version-dependent `grovedbProof` encoding, while address-tree sync endpoints use different
proof-bearing response shapes. See [Proof internals](#proof-internals) and [Address tree sync
verification](#address-tree-sync-verification), respectively.

## Verifying proofs

Dash Platform SDKs parse and verify standard requested proofs automatically. Verification is
performed by the `rs-drive-proof-verifier` crate, which checks the quorum's BLS threshold
signature (the Tenderdash consensus half) and decodes the unified `grovedbProof` to recover the
requested data and the state root hash. Direct clients must also handle the protocol-specific
compacted proof envelope and bare `merkProof` paths described below. Applications performing
verification directly can use `rs-drive-proof-verifier`; JavaScript and browser applications can
use the available WebAssembly bindings.

See the [Proofs](../explanations/proofs.md) explanation for the step-by-step verification flow.

## Proof internals

The `grovedbProof` value is an opaque binary blob. Its byte-level format -- the stack-based proof
operators, node types, absence proofs, the V0/V1 proof formats, and the verification algorithm --
is documented in the [GroveDB Proof System
documentation](https://dashpay.github.io/grovedb/proof-system.html). Clients that use an SDK do
not need to work at this level.

### Compacted address balance proofs

:::{versionchanged} 4.1.0
At protocol version 13 and above, the `grovedbProof` returned by
[`getRecentCompactedAddressBalanceChanges`](../reference/dapi-endpoints-platform-endpoints.md#getrecentcompactedaddressbalancechanges)
is not a single GroveDB proof. It is a [bincode envelope carrying two independent GroveDB
proofs](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v4.1.0/packages/rs-drive/src/verify/address_funds/verify_compacted_address_balance_changes/mod.rs#L21-L30):

- a **predecessor proof**, which authenticates which compacted range contains the requested start height, and
- a **forward proof**, verified against a query derived only from that authenticated result.

Both proofs must commit to the same state root hash. Binding the forward query's start key to an
independently verified predecessor result makes this trust model slightly stronger than the
single-proof case. Protocol version 12 and below use the legacy single-proof format for this
response.

A verifier written for the single-proof model will fail to decode a protocol version 13 compacted
proof, so clients implementing verification outside the provided SDKs must handle both formats and
select by protocol version.

## Address tree sync verification

The two address-tree sync endpoints used for incremental address balance sync differ from the rest
of the Platform surface. Neither takes a `prove` parameter; both always return proof data.

[`getAddressesTrunkState`](../reference/dapi-endpoints-platform-endpoints.md#getaddressestrunkstate)
returns a standard `Proof` message plus response metadata. Because the proof is anchored to the
returned checkpoint height rather than the chain tip, a verifier must resolve the signing quorum
at that checkpoint height or signature verification will fail.

[`getAddressesBranchState`](../reference/dapi-endpoints-platform-endpoints.md#getaddressesbranchstate)
is the further exception: its response carries neither a `Proof` message nor a `metadata` block,
only a bare `merkProof` byte string with no signature of its own. See the endpoint references for
the checkpoint workflow and request/response details.

# Platform Address System

:::{attention}
Address-based state transitions were introduced in **Protocol Version 11**. These transitions enable direct operations using Platform addresses without requiring a pre-existing identity for some operations.
:::

## Overview

Address-based state transitions provide an alternative funding and transfer mechanism using Platform addresses. Unlike identity-signed transactions that require an existing identity with keys, address-based operations can work directly with cryptographic proofs tied to address ownership.

There are six address-based state transition types:

| Type | Name | Description |
|------|------|-------------|
| 9 | [Identity Credit Transfer to Addresses](#identity-credit-transfer-to-addresses) | Transfer credits from identity to Platform addresses |
| 10 | [Identity Create from Addresses](#identity-create-from-addresses) | Create identity funded from Platform addresses |
| 11 | [Identity Top-Up from Addresses](#identity-top-up-from-addresses) | Top up existing identity from Platform addresses |
| 12 | [Address Funds Transfer](#address-funds-transfer) | Transfer between Platform addresses |
| 13 | [Address Funding from Asset Lock](#address-funding-from-asset-lock) | Fund Platform addresses from asset lock |
| 14 | [Address Credit Withdrawal](#address-credit-withdrawal) | Withdraw from Platform addresses to Core |

## Common Components

### Platform Address

Platform addresses are derived from standard Bitcoin/Dash address formats and encoded using bech32m per [DIP-0018](https://github.com/dashpay/dips/blob/master/dip-0018.md).

| Variant  | Type Byte | Size     | Description                                          |
| ------- | ---- | -------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `P2PKH` | 0xb0 | 21 bytes | Pay-to-Public-Key-Hash (1 type byte + 20 hash bytes) |
| `P2SH`  | 0x80 | 21 bytes | Pay-to-Script-Hash (1 type byte + 20 hash bytes)     |

**Encoding:**

- **Mainnet HRP:** `evo`
- **Testnet HRP:** `tevo`

**Derivation:** Standard Bitcoin derivation using `Hash160(compressed_pubkey)` where Hash160 = RIPEMD160(SHA256(x)).

See the [Platform address implementation in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.0.0/packages/rs-dpp/src/address_funds/platform_address.rs).

### Address Witness

Witnesses provide cryptographic proof of address ownership. Each input in an address-based transition requires a corresponding witness.

| Variant  | Size     | Fields                   | Description                                     |
|----------|----------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------ |
| `P2pkh`  | 65 bytes | signature                | Recoverable ECDSA signature                     |
| `P2sh`   | Varies   | signatures, redeemScript | Multiple signatures with multisig redeem script |

**P2PKH Verification:**

1. Double-SHA256 hash the signable bytes
2. Recover public key from recoverable signature
3. Hash160 the recovered pubkey
4. Compare with address hash

**P2SH Multisig Verification:**

1. Verify redeem script hashes to address
2. Parse script for threshold (M) and public keys (N)
3. Hash signable bytes once (reused for all signatures)
4. Match M signatures to N public keys in order

See the [witness implementation in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.0.0/packages/rs-dpp/src/address_funds/witness.rs).

### Fee Strategy

The fee strategy specifies how transaction fees are deducted from inputs or outputs.

| Step Type         | Type             | Size    | Description                              |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|------------------------------------------|
| `DeductFromInput` | unsigned integer | 16 bits | Deduct fee from input at specified index |
| `ReduceOutput`    | unsigned integer | 16 bits | Reduce output amount to cover fee        |

:::{note}
Fee strategy cannot be empty. Maximum steps: 4 (`max_address_fee_strategies`). No duplicate steps allowed. Steps are processed in sequence until the fee is fully covered.
:::

See the [fee strategy implementation in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.0.0/packages/rs-dpp/src/address_funds/fee_strategy/mod.rs).

### Common Type Aliases

| Type              | Definition       | Size    | Description                                      |
|-------------------|------------------|---------|--------------------------------------------------|
| `AddressNonce`    | unsigned integer | 32 bits | Sequential counter per address (prevents replay) |
| `Credits`         | unsigned integer | 64 bits | Platform credit unit                             |
| `UserFeeIncrease` | unsigned integer | 16 bits | User-specified fee multiplier                    |

### Address Funding from Asset Lock

Fund Platform addresses from a Core chain asset lock special transaction.

| inputWitnesses  | array            | Varies   | [Address witnesses](#address-witness) for any existing address inputs                |

This transition uses **dual signing**: an asset lock signature proves ownership of locked funds, and address witnesses prove ownership of any existing address inputs (if combining funds).

:::{important}
Exactly one output must have a `None` value. This remainder output receives whatever funds remain after explicit outputs and fees are satisfied, ensuring full consumption of the asset lock.
:::

:::{note}
**Constraints:** Minimum outputs: 1. Maximum inputs: `max_address_inputs`. Maximum outputs: `max_address_outputs`. Minimum per input: 100,000 credits. Minimum per explicit output: 500,000 credits. No output can also be an input.

:::{note}
**Constraints:** Minimum inputs: 1. Maximum inputs: `max_address_inputs`. Minimum per input: 100,000 credits. Minimum output: 500,000 credits. Pooling must be `Never` (others not yet implemented). Output script must be P2PKH or P2SH.

**Fee:** 400,000,000 credits. Withdrawal fees are significantly higher due to the complexity and finality of moving funds back to the Core chain.

### Address State Transition Signing

Address-based state transitions use different signing methods depending on the type. See the [state transition signing](./state-transition.md#state-transition-signing) page for full signing details.

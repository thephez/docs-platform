# Document

## Document Overview

Once a [data contract](./data-contract.md) has been created, data can be stored by submitting documents that comply with the document structure specified in the contract. Each document consists of one or more fields and the indices necessary to support querying. Documents are [created](#document-create-transition), [replaced](#document-replace-transition), [deleted](#document-delete-transition), [transferred](#document-transfer-transition), [purchased](#document-purchase-transition), or have their [price updated](#document-update-price-transition) by submitting them to the platform in a [batch state transition](./state-transition.md#batch).

## Document State Transition Details

All document transitions include the [document base transition fields](#document-base-transition). Some document transitions (e.g., [document create](#document-create-transition)) require additional fields to provide their functionality.

### Document Base Transition

The following fields are included in all document transitions. Note that `$action` is present in the JSON wire format as a type discriminator (see [Document Transition Action](#document-transition-action)) but is not a stored field in the base transition structure — it is derived from the transition variant type.

| Field | Type | Size | Description|
| ----- | ---- | ---- | ---------- |
| [$id](#document-id) | array | 32 bytes | The [document ID](#document-id) |
| $identityContractNonce | unsigned integer | 64 bits  | Identity contract nonce |
| $type | string | 1-64 characters | Name of a document type found in the data contract associated with the `dataContractId`|
| $dataContractId | array | 32 bytes | Data contract ID [generated](../protocol-ref/data-contract.md#data-contract-id) from the data contract's `ownerId` and `identity nonce` |
| [$tokenPaymentInfo](#token-payment-info) | object | Varies | (Optional, V1+) Token-based fee payment information for this transition |

Each document transition must comply with the [document base transition defined in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/state_transition/state_transitions/document/batch_transition/batched_transition/document_base_transition/v1/mod.rs#L38-L56).

#### Document id

The document `$id` is created by double sha256 hashing the document's `dataContractId`, `ownerId`, `type`, and `entropy` as shown in [rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/document/generate_document_id.rs).

```rust
// From the Rust reference implementation (rs-dpp)
// generate_document_id.rs
pub fn generate_document_id_v0(
    contract_id: &Identifier,
    owner_id: &Identifier,
    document_type_name: &str,
    entropy: &[u8],
) -> Identifier {
    let mut buf: Vec<u8> = vec![];

    buf.extend_from_slice(&contract_id.to_buffer());
    buf.extend_from_slice(&owner_id.to_buffer());
    buf.extend_from_slice(document_type_name.as_bytes());
    buf.extend_from_slice(entropy);

    Identifier::from_bytes(&hash_double_to_vec(&buf)).unwrap()
}
```

#### Token Payment Info

When a document type requires token payment (configured via [`tokenCost`](./data-contract-document.md#token-costs) in the data contract), the `$tokenPaymentInfo` object specifies which token to use and the cost limits the client is willing to accept. The object is defined in [rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/tokens/token_payment_info/v0/mod.rs#L36-L56).

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| paymentTokenContractId | array | 32 bytes | (Optional) Identifier of the contract containing the payment token. Defaults to the current contract if omitted. |
| tokenContractPosition | unsigned integer | 16 bits | Position of the token within the contract to use for payment |
| minimumTokenCost | unsigned integer | 64 bits | (Optional) Minimum acceptable token cost. Not typically set by clients. |
| maximumTokenCost | unsigned integer | 64 bits | (Optional) Maximum token cost the client is willing to pay. Recommended when the contract allows prices to be changed, to protect against unexpected cost increases. |
| gasFeesPaidBy | integer | 8 bits | Who pays the gas fees for the operation:<br>`0` - Document owner (default)<br>`1` - Contract owner<br>`2` - Prefer contract owner (falls back to document owner if insufficient) |

::: {note}
The `gasFeesPaidBy` value must match what the data contract's `tokenCost` configuration allows for the operation type.
:::

#### Entropy Generation

Dash Platform uses the following entropy generator found in [rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/util/entropy_generator.rs#L9-L14):

```rust
// From the Rust reference implementation (rs-dpp)
// entropy_generator.rs
fn generate(&self) -> anyhow::Result<[u8; 32]> {
   let mut buffer = [0u8; 32];
   getrandom::getrandom(&mut buffer)
      .map_err(|e| anyhow::anyhow!(format!("generating entropy failed: {}", e)))?;
   Ok(buffer)
}
```

#### Document Transition Action

Document transition actions indicate what operation platform should perform with the provided transition data. Documents provide CRUD functionality, ownership transfer, and NFT features as [defined in rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/state_transition/state_transitions/document/batch_transition/batched_transition/document_transition_action_type.rs#L6-L14).

| Action | Name | Description |
| :-: | - | - |
| 0 | [Create](#document-create-transition) | Create a new document with the provided data |
| 1 | [Replace](#document-replace-transition) | Replace an existing document with the provided data |
| 2 | [Delete](#document-delete-transition) | Delete the referenced document |
| 3 | [Transfer](#document-transfer-transition) | Transfer the referenced document to a new owner |
| 4 | [Purchase](#document-purchase-transition) | Purchase the referenced document |
| 5 | [Update price](#document-update-price-transition) | Update the price for the document |
| 6 | IgnoreWhileBumpingRevision | Internal action type used to bypass revision bump |

### Document Create Transition

The document create transition extends the [base transition](#document-base-transition) to include the following additional fields:

| Field | Type | Size | Description |
| - | - | - | - |
| $entropy | array | 32 bytes | Entropy used in creating the [document ID](#document-id). Generated as [shown here](#entropy-generation). |
| data | | Varies | Document data being submitted. |
| $prefundedVotingBalance | | Varies | (Optional) Prefunded amount of credits reserved for unique index conflict resolution voting (e.g., [premium DPNS name](../explanations/dpns.md#conflict-resolution)).|

Each document create transition must comply with the structure defined in [rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/state_transition/state_transitions/document/batch_transition/batched_transition/document_create_transition/v0/mod.rs#L57-L78) (in addition to the [document base transition](#document-base-transition) that is required for all document transitions).

::: {note}
The document create transition data field must include all [required document properties](./data-contract-document.md#required-properties) specified in the data contract.
:::

The following example document create transition and subsequent table demonstrate how the document transition base, document create transition, and data contract document definitions are assembled into a complete transition for inclusion in a [state transition](#document-overview):

## Document Object

The document object represents the data provided by the platform in response to a query. Responses consist of an array of these objects containing the following fields as defined in the Rust reference client ([rs-dpp](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/document/v0/mod.rs#L39-L124)):

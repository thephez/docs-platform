# Data Trigger

## Data Trigger Overview

Although [data contracts](../protocol-ref/data-contract.md) provide much needed constraints on the structure of the data being stored on Dash Platform, there are limits to what they can do. Certain system data contracts may require server-side validation logic to operate effectively. For example, [DPNS](../explanations/dpns.md) must enforce some rules to ensure names remain DNS compatible. Dash Platform Protocol (DPP) supports this application-specific custom logic using Data Triggers.

## Details

Since all application data is submitted in the form of documents, data triggers are defined in the context of documents. To provide even more granularity, they also incorporate the [document transition action](../protocol-ref/document.md#document-transition-action) so separate triggers can be created for the CREATE, REPLACE, or DELETE actions.

When document state transitions are received, DPP checks if there is a trigger associated with the document transition type and action. If there is, it then executes the trigger logic.

**Note:** Successful execution of the trigger logic is necessary for the document to be accepted and applied to the platform state.

### Example

As an example, DPP contains several data triggers for DPNS as defined in the [data trigger bindings](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v3.1-dev/packages/rs-drive-abci/src/execution/validation/state_transition/state_transitions/batch/data_triggers/bindings/list/v0/mod.rs). The `domain` document has added constraints for creation, replacement or deletion:

| Data Contract | Document           | Action(s)                                                                                                                            | Trigger Description                                                                                      |

**DPNS Trigger Constraints**

The following table details the DPNS constraints applied via data triggers. These constraints are in addition to the ones applied directly by the DPNS data contract.

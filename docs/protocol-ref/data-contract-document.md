# Contract Documents

## Contract Document Overview

The `documents` object defines each type of document in the data contract. At a minimum, a document must consist of 1 or more properties. The `additionalProperties` properties keyword must be included as described in the [constraints](./data-contract.md#additional-properties) section and each property must be [assigned a position](#assigning-position).

The following example shows a minimal `documents` object defining a single document (`note`) with one property (`message`).

```json
{
  "note": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "message": {
        "type": "string",
        "position": 0
      }
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  }
}
```

Documents may also define [indices](#document-indices), a list of [required](#required-properties) or [transient](#transient-properties) properties, and a custom [configuration](#document-configuration). Refer to this table for a brief description of the major document sections:

| Feature    | Description                                   |
|------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| [Configuration](#document-configuration) | Document-level settings affecting behavior such as mutability, deletion, and transferability  |
| [Properties](#document-properties) | Definitions and constraints for each field within a document  |
| [Indices](#document-indices)       | Definitions for indexing document fields to support efficient querying |

## Document Properties

The `properties` object defines each field that a document will use. Each field consists of an object that, at a minimum, must define its data `type` (`string`, `number`, `integer`, `boolean`, `array`, `object`).

Fields may also apply a variety of optional JSON Schema constraints related to the format, range, length, etc. of the data. A full explanation of JSON Schema capabilities is beyond the scope of this document. For more information regarding its data types and the constraints that can be applied, please refer to the [JSON Schema reference](https://json-schema.org/understanding-json-schema/reference/index.html) documentation.

### Assigning Position

Each property in a level must be assigned a unique `position` value, with ordering starting at zero and incrementing with each property. When using nested objects, position counting resets to zero for each level. This structure supports backward compatibility in data contracts by [ensuring consistent ordering](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/pull/1594) for serialization and deserialization processes.

### Object Properties

The `object` type cannot be an empty object but must have one or more defined properties. For example, the `body` property shown below is an object containing a single string property (`objectProperty`):

```javascript
const contractDocuments = {
  message: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      body: {
        type: "object",
        position: 0,
        properties: {
          objectProperty: {
            type: "string",
            "position": 0
          },
        },
        additionalProperties: false,
      },
      header: {
        type: "string",
        "position": 1
      }
    },
    additionalProperties: false
  }
};
```

### Required Properties

Each document may have some fields that are required for the document to be valid and other fields that are optional. Required fields are defined via the `required` array, which consists of a list of the field names from the document that must be present. Exclude the `required` object for documents without required properties.

```json
"required": [
  "<field name a>",
  "<field name b>"
]
```

**Example**  
The following example (excerpt from the DPNS contract's `domain` document) demonstrates a document with required fields:

```json
"required": [
  "$createdAt",
  "$updatedAt",
  "$transferredAt",
  "label",
  "normalizedLabel",
  "normalizedParentDomainName",
  "preorderSalt",
  "records",
  "subdomainRules"
]
```

### Transient Properties

Each document may have transient fields that require validation but do not need to be stored by the system once validated. Transient fields are defined in the `transient` array. Only include the `transient` object for documents with at least one transient property.

**Example**  

The following example (from the [DPNS contract's `domain` document](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/master/packages/dpns-contract/schema/v1/dpns-contract-documents.json)) demonstrates a document that has 1 transient field:

```json
    "transient": [
      "preorderSalt"
    ]
```

### Property Constraints

There are a variety of constraints currently defined for performance and security reasons.

| Description | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Minimum number of properties | [1](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L22) |
| Maximum number of properties | [100](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L23) |
| Minimum property name length | [1](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L20) |
| Maximum property name length | [64](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L20) |
| Property name characters     | Alphanumeric (`A-Z`, `a-z`, `0-9`)<br>Hyphen (`-`) <br>Underscore (`_`) |

## Document Indices

Document indices may be defined if indexing on document fields is required. The `indices` object should only be included for documents with at least one index.

The `indices` array consists of one or more objects that each contain:

* A unique `name` for the index
* A `properties` array composed of a `<field name: sort order>` object for each document field that is part of the index
  
  :::{admonition} Compound Indices
  :class: attention
  When defining an index with multiple properties, the ordering of properties is important. Refer to the [mongoDB documentation](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/index-compound/#prefixes) for details. Dash uses [GroveDB](https://github.com/dashpay/grovedb), which works similarly but requires listing all the index's fields in query order by statements.
  :::
* An optional `unique` element that determines if duplicate values are allowed for the document
* An optional `nullSearchable` element that indicates whether the index allows searching for NULL values. If nullSearchable is false (default: true) and all properties of the index are null then no reference is added.
* An optional `contested` element that determines if duplicate values are allowed for the document

```json
"indices": [
  {
    "name": "<index name a>",
    "properties": [
      { "<field name a>": "<asc"|"desc>" },
      { "<field name b>": "<asc"|"desc>" }
    ],
    "unique": true|false,
    "nullSearchable": true|false,
    "contested": {
      "fieldMatches": [
        {
          "field": "<field name a>",
          "regexPattern": "<regex>"
        }
      ],
      "resolution": 0
    }
  },
  {
    "name": "<index name b>",
    "properties": [
      { "<field name c>": "<asc"|"desc>" },
    ],
  }
]
```

### Contested Indices

Contested unique indices provide a way for multiple identities to compete for ownership when a new document field matches a predefined pattern. This system enables fair distribution of valuable documents, such as [premium DPNS names](../explanations/dpns.md#conflict-resolution), through community-driven decision-making.

A two week contest begins when a match occurs. For the first week, additional contenders can join by paying a fee of 0.2 Dash. During this period, masternodes and evonodes vote on the outcome. The contest can result in the awarding of the document to the winner, a locked vote where no document is awarded, or potentially a restart of the contest if specific conditions are met.

The table below describes the properties used to configure a contested index:

| Property Name | Type | Description |
|-|-|-|
| fieldMatches | array | Array containing conditions to check |
| fieldMatches.field | string | Name of the field to check for matches |
| fieldMatches.regexPattern | string | Regex used to check for matches |
| resolution | integer | Method to resolve the contest:<br>`0` - masternode voting |

**Example**

This example (from the [DPNS contract's `domain` document](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/master/packages/dpns-contract/schema/v1/dpns-contract-documents.json)) demonstrates the use of a contested index:

``` json
"contested": {
  "fieldMatches": [
    {
      "field": "normalizedLabel",
      "regexPattern": "^[a-zA-Z01-]{3,19}$"
    }
  ],
  "resolution": 0,
  "description": "If the normalized label part of this index is less than 20 characters (all alphabet a-z, A-Z, 0, 1, and -) then a masternode vote contest takes place to give out the name"
}
```

### Index Constraints

For performance and security reasons, indices have the following constraints. These constraints are subject to change over time.

| Description | Value |
| ----------- | ----- |
| Minimum/maximum length of index `name` | [1](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L311) / [32](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L312) |
| Maximum number of indices | [10](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L390) |
| Maximum number of unique indices | [10](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-platform-version/src/version/dpp_versions/dpp_validation_versions/v2.rs#L27) |
| Maximum number of contested indices | [1](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-platform-version/src/version/dpp_versions/dpp_validation_versions/v2.rs#L26) |
| Maximum number of properties in a single index | [10](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json#L331) |
| Maximum length of indexed string property | [63](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/data_contract/document_type/class_methods/try_from_schema/mod.rs#L34) |
| Usage of `$id` in an index [disallowed](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/pull/178) | N/A |
| **Note: Dash Platform [does not allow indices for arrays](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/pull/225).**<br>Maximum length of indexed byte array property | [255](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/data_contract/document_type/class_methods/try_from_schema/mod.rs#L35) |
| **Note: Dash Platform [does not allow indices for arrays](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/pull/225).**<br>Maximum number of indexed array items         | [1024](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/src/data_contract/document_type/class_methods/try_from_schema/mod.rs#L36) |

**Example**  
The following example (excerpt from the DPNS contract's `preorder` document) creates an index named `saltedHash` on the `saltedDomainHash` property that also enforces uniqueness across all documents of that type:

```json
"indices": [
  {
    "name": "saltedHash",
    "properties": [
      {
        "saltedDomainHash": "asc"
      }
    ],
    "unique": true
  }
]
```

## Document Configuration

Documents support the following configuration options to provide flexibility in contract design. Only include configuration options in a data contract when using non-default values.

| Document option | Type | Description |
|-----------------|------|-------------|
| `documentsKeepHistory`               | boolean  | If true, documents keep a history of all changes. Default: false. |

:::{dropdown} List of all usable document properties

  This list of properties is defined in the [Rust DPP implementation](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/master/packages/rs-dpp/src/data_contract/document_type/mod.rs#L31) and the [document meta-schema](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/master/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json).

:::

**Example**

The following example (from the [DPNS contract's `domain` document](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/master/packages/dpns-contract/schema/v1/dpns-contract-documents.json)) demonstrates the use of several configuration options:

```json
{
  "domain": {
    "documentsMutable": false,
    "canBeDeleted": true,
    "transferable": 1,
    "tradeMode": 1,
    "..."
  }
}
```

## Keyword Constraints

There are a variety of keyword constraints currently defined for performance and security reasons. The
following constraints apply to document definitions. Unless otherwise noted, these
constraints are defined in the platform's JSON Schema rules (e.g., [rs-dpp document meta
schema](https://github.com/dashpay/platform/blob/v2.0-dev/packages/rs-dpp/schema/meta_schemas/document/v0/document-meta.json)).

| Keyword | Constraint |
| ------- | ---------- |
| `default`                   | Restricted - cannot be used (defined in DPP logic)  |
| `propertyNames`             | Restricted - cannot be used (defined in DPP logic) |
| `uniqueItems: true`         | `maxItems` must be defined (maximum: 100000) |
| `pattern: <something>`      | `maxLength` must be defined (maximum: 50000) |
| `format: <something>`       | `maxLength` must be defined (maximum: 50000) |
| `$ref: <something>`         | **Disabled**<br>`$ref` can only reference `$defs`. Remote references not supported. |
| `if`, `then`, `else`, `allOf`, `anyOf`, `oneOf`, `not` | Disabled for data contracts |
| `dependencies`              | Not supported. Use `dependentRequired` and `dependentSchema` instead |
| `additionalItems`           | Not supported. Use `items: false` and `prefixItems` instead |
| `patternProperties`         | Restricted - cannot be used for data contracts |
| `pattern`                   | Accept only [RE2](https://github.com/google/re2/wiki/Syntax) compatible regular expressions (defined in DPP logic) |

## Example Syntax

This example syntax shows the structure of a documents object that defines two documents, an index, and a required field.

```json
{
  "<document name a>": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "<field name b>": {
        "type": "<field data type>",
        "position": "<number>"
      },
      "<field name c>": {
        "type": "<field data type>",
        "position": "<number>"
      },
    },
    "indices": [
      {
        "name": "<index name>",
        "properties": [
          {
            "<field name c>": "asc"
          }
        ],
        "unique": true|false
      },
    ],
    "required": [
      "<field name c>"
    ],
    "additionalProperties": false
  },
  "<document name x>": {
    "type": "object",
    "properties": {
      "<property name y>": {
        "type": "<property data type>",
        "position": "<number>"
      },
      "<property name z>": {
        "type": "<property data type>",
        "position": "<number>"
      },
    },
    "additionalProperties": false
  },    
}
```
